### Project Overview

The **PsSysAdminGadgets** console project interfaces with hardware components like buttons, RGB LEDs, an OLED display, and various connected peripherals. The project is designed to:
- Provide basic controls via GPIO (buttons, LEDs).
- Display system and gadget information via I2C on an SSD1306 OLED display.
- Communicate with peripheral gadgets via an RJ45 connection, allowing modular expansion of additional sensors, actuators, and other control devices.
- Handle power management using USB-C for basic operation and an auxiliary power supply for more power-hungry gadgets.

This repository will be modular and scalable, with future plans to integrate with a GUI wrapper project.

### Hardware Requirements

To use **PsSysAdminGadgets**, you will need the following hardware components:

### Development Phases

The project is broken into development phases to progressively build the toolkitâ€™s features and prepare for future GUI integration.

#### Phase 1: Core Console App with GPIO and I2C Integration
- **Goal**: Set up the core hardware interfacing with buttons, LEDs, and the SSD1306 OLED display.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize GPIO for buttons and RGB LEDs.
  - Interface with the SSD1306 display over I2C to show system status.
  - Implement a basic control loop that toggles LEDs based on button presses.
  - Display status information (e.g., button press feedback, system uptime) on the OLED display.
- **Outcome**: A working console app that interacts with basic hardware.

#### Phase 2: RJ45 Peripheral Communication
- **Goal**: Establish communication with peripherals connected via the RJ45 breakout board.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define the data protocol for communication with connected gadgets.
  - Implement pin management (C0-C8) for peripheral interactions.
  - Send and receive data between the main gadget and peripheral devices.
- **Outcome**: A system that can communicate and control connected gadgets via the RJ45 interface.

#### Phase 3: Power Management Integration
- **Goal**: Add support for auxiliary power to handle power-hungry peripherals.
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate power switching logic (use relays or GPIO-controlled circuits) to manage auxiliary power supply.
  - Implement current monitoring or voltage checks to ensure safe power distribution.
  - Ensure peripherals can switch between USB-C and auxiliary power when required.
- **Outcome**: Stable power management with both USB-C and auxiliary power support.

#### Phase 4: PowerShell Module Integration
- **Goal**: Package the console app as a PowerShell module for easy usage by IT administrators.
- **Tasks**:
  - Wrap core functionalities in PowerShell cmdlets.
  - Export key functions (e.g., gadget control, system monitoring) as cmdlets.
  - Ensure cross-compatibility between the console app and PowerShell environment.
- **Outcome**: A PowerShell module that wraps the core console functionalities.

#### Phase 5: Future Expansion (Optional)
- **Goal**: Build advanced functionalities for the control gadget and prepare for GUI integration.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add new peripherals (e.g., temperature sensors, servos) connected via the RJ45 breakout.
  - Optimize the communication protocol for multiple gadgets.
  - Prepare the console app for seamless transition to a WPF GUI wrapper.
- **Outcome**: A feature-rich console project that can be expanded with additional gadgets.
